Thanks for your interest in contributing. This project is intentionally lightweight, so the contribution workflow is kept simple and explicit. Please read this fully before starting.

## 📦 Project Structure

```
react-confirm-lite/
├─ src/               # Library source code
├─ dist/              # Built output (generated)
├─ example/           # Local playground app (Vite + React)
├─ CONTRIBUTING.md
├─ README.md
├─ package.json
├─ tsup.config.ts
```

* **src/** → where you make changes
* **dist/** → auto-generated by tsup (do not edit manually)
* **example/** → used to test changes locally

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

* Node.js >= 18
* npm >= 9
* Basic familiarity with React + TypeScript

---

## 🚀 Local Development Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SaadNasir-git/react-confirm-lite.git
cd react-confirm-lite
```

### 2. Install dependencies (root)

```bash
npm install
```

---

## 🔁 Development Workflow (IMPORTANT)

This project uses **tsup watch mode** for live rebuilding.

### Terminal 1 — Run library in watch mode

From the project root:

```bash
npm run build:watch
```

This will:

* Watch `src/` for changes
* Automatically rebuild `dist/`
* Re-run post-build steps when files change

⚠️ Leave this terminal running.

---

### Terminal 2 — Run example app

```bash
cd example
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the provided local URL in your browser.

---

## 🧪 How to Test Your Changes

1. Modify files inside `src/`
2. tsup automatically rebuilds the library
3. Refresh the browser running the example app
4. Verify behavior visually and via console logs

You **do not** need to:

* run `npm pack`
* reinstall the package
* publish to npm

This setup mirrors real-world library development.

---

## 🧠 What to Change (and What Not to)

### ✅ You can change

* Logic in `src/`
* Types in `types.ts`
* Styles / animations
* README documentation

### ❌ Do not change

* `dist/` files manually
* Version number (maintainer handles releases)
* Build configuration unless discussed

---

## 🧹 Code Style

* Use TypeScript types explicitly
* Avoid unnecessary abstractions
* Prefer clarity over cleverness
* Keep bundle size in mind

---

## 🐞 Reporting Bugs

When opening an issue, include:

* What you expected
* What actually happened
* Steps to reproduce
* Browser and React version

---

## 💡 Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome, but keep in mind:

* This library aims to stay minimal
* Features should not add heavy dependencies
* API simplicity is a priority
